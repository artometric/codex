## Overview

*Codex: A Legendarium* is a transmedia system composed of seven interconnected projects — spanning technology, education, narrative fiction, nonfiction critique, and personal mythology. It functions as both an artistic mythos and a scientific production model: a blueprint for building the future by decoding the past. Together, these projects form a recursive framework — designed to explore meaning, memory, and power across media, platforms, and lives.

**The seven projects:**

-   **Artometric** – The analytical platform and studio engine
-   **Prism & Pollen** – A physical makerspace and cultural venue
-   **Cardinal** – An exposé on Stanford and techno-capitalism
-   **Dawn** – An AI-animated lecture series on systems and ethics
-   **Trinity** – A philosophical sci-fi trilogy of rebellion and recursion
-   **The Economic Artist** – A newsletter for cultural strategy and IP critique
-   **KSM** – The personal archive: memoir, music, and myth
