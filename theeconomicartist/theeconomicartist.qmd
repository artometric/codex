# THE ECONOMIC ARTIST {.unnumbered}

## Overview

**The Economic Artist** is an ongoing newsletter, research journal, and strategic portfolio built around a single question: *What happens when artists think like economists — and economists think like mythmakers?* At its core, this project explores the intersection of economics, storytelling, and cultural systems — with a particular focus on how large intellectual properties (like DC Comics) succeed, collapse, or transform over time. It is part commentary, part theory, and part pitch deck — designed to influence franchises, provoke thought, and build bridges between independent artists and institutional media.

## Format

-   **Primary format**: Longform newsletter hosted on Beehiiv (or Ghost)
-   **Frequency**: Weekly to bi-weekly posts
-   **Tone**: Clear, sharp, interdisciplinary — grounded in economics, but written for creatives
-   **Additional formats**:
    -   Audio essays (for podcast feed)
    -   Visual decks and pitch slides
    -   Short speculative essays on IP futures
    -   Collaborator interviews and annotated story analysis

## Core Topics

The Economic Artist blends cultural critique with practical application. Each post focuses on a key idea or case study. Topics include:

-   **Franchise strategy**: Why some universes thrive and others fragment

-   **DCU worldbuilding**: Canon inconsistencies (e.g. multiple Hells), thematic gaps, and missed opportunities

-   **Economic storytelling**: How myths encode systems — from interest rates to moral law

-   **Speculative development**: Reimagining Constantine, Swamp Thing, Gotham, or Justice League from first principles

-   **Myth as asset class**: How IP becomes capital, and how artists can challenge or reclaim it

-   **Industry power maps**: Tracking influence between studios, showrunners, and executives The result is a living toolkit for both creators and analysts — a bridge between theory and production.

## Strategic Purpose

The newsletter is not just commentary — it’s a positioning tool. It serves multiple functions:

-   **Proof of concept**: Show how story and economics can be fused to generate real IP value

-   **Open portfolio**: A public body of work that can be shared with studios, collaborators, or readers

-   **Outreach vehicle**: A way to connect with DC Studios, creative executives, or like-minded artists

-   **Cultural intervention**: Offer alternative futures for IPs currently locked in stagnation or incoherence

## DC Focus

A special focus is given to the **DC Universe**, specifically under the leadership of James Gunn. Areas of interest include:

-   Resolving contradictions in DC canon (e.g. theology, time, identity)

-   Economic and moral analysis of characters like Lex Luthor, Bruce Wayne, and John Constantine

-   Worldbuilding strategies for long-term narrative cohesion

-   Pitches and redesigns for overlooked characters or dormant corners of the multiverse This focus is not fan service — it’s a serious effort to apply economic and symbolic logic to one of the most valuable (and most mismanaged) IP catalogs in the world.

## Style and Influences

The Economic Artist draws inspiration from:

-   Indie strategists like Packy McCormick and Not Boring

-   Cultural theorists like McLuhan, Žižek, and Lewis Hyde

-   Franchise repair thinkers like Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, and Warren Ellis

-   Internal decks like the Sony IP Bible or the Marvel Phase documents

    -   The tone is accessible but ambitious. Designed to be read by both writers and producers. Both marketers and mystics.

## Why It Matters

We are entering a new era of cultural infrastructure. Franchises are no longer just entertainment — they are platforms, currencies, belief systems. If the 20th century was about the economic artist as outsider, the 21st will be about the economic artist as architect. This newsletter is both a study and a signal. A way to think differently — and a way to show what’s possible.
