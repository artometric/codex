# ARTOMETRIC {.unnumbered}

## Overview  
*The platform where meaning becomes measurable.*

Artometric is the core technological project of *Codex: A Legendarium*. It’s a digital platform designed to explore culture as a system — mapping how ideas, trends, and creative movements evolve over time. Equal parts research tool, creative lab, and media studio, Artometric helps users see the structure behind art, media, and memory.

## What It Does

Artometric gives users two ways to explore cultural data:

- **Analyst Mode** is a visual dashboard interface that lets users explore large datasets — from music genres and story arcs to fashion patterns and historical influences. Users can build visualizations, annotate timelines, and export datasets to use in their own research or creative work.

- **Player Mode** turns data exploration into a gamified experience. Using a pixel-art world inspired by classic RPGs, users walk through historical eras, unlock narrative quests, and discover how cultural ideas connect across time.

Together, these two modes create a platform that is both analytical and imaginative — useful for students, artists, researchers, and worldbuilders.

## Key Features

- Curated datasets across music, books, media, fashion, and design  
- Interactive dashboards with timeline, map, and network views  
- Exportable data (CSV, JSON, image formats) for remixing or research  
- A modular interface built with React and Next.js  
- Gamified quests for exploring culture as an RPG  
- Creator tools for storyboarding, remixing, and dataset annotation  
- Public API (planned) for developers and educators

## Studio Division

Artometric includes a built-in studio that develops original content based on insights from the platform. This studio produces:

- Anime based on narrative patterns  
- Manga exploring symbolic timelines  
- Podcasts that analyze cultural trends  
- Music generated from genre and rhythm analytics  
- Essays and visual projects that remix historical data

The Studio transforms cultural analysis into original creative media, demonstrating how data can inspire new mythologies.

## Future Vision

Planned expansions for Artometric include:

- A mobile app for daily insights, journaling, and creative prompts  
- VR and AR experiences for immersive data exploration  
- Creator plug-ins for modular tools and storytelling templates  
- Academic and studio partnerships for co-produced research and media  
- Fellowship programs for platform-native creators

## Why It Matters

Culture moves in patterns. Stories repeat. Symbols echo. Artometric helps users see those patterns clearly — and gives them the tools to turn that insight into something new.
By blending analysis and creativity, Artometric becomes more than a tool — it becomes a new way to engage with meaning itself.
